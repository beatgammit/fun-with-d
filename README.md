D is fun
========

I like programming in D, so I started this repo to keep some code snippets. Feel free to look around and take whatever you like!

Most of the things here were created as part of a bigger project. Everything here is under whatever open-source license you like, meaning I really don't care if you take stuff, just don't blame me if it doesn't work.

For more information on the D programming language, see the [main website](dlang.org).
